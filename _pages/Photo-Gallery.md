completely accurate in what an episode entails AND proves why its kino.
kinda like sports, if you score a goal by either lightly tapping the ball into the net, or a extremely fancy display of footwork and speed, you still only score once. Burn notice is good because they knew what worked, and kept at it.
>those episodes where his mom would help out
to this day i still use one of the spy 'tips' in the episode, where you get friendly with a bank worker by using pictures or items on their desk to talk them into doing what you want
{% include gallery caption="Inside the bunker." %}
