<p>  When the thought of abandoned or, dare I say, haunted psychiatric centers comes to mind, most think of the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center(KPPC). Even those who do not consider themselves all too adventurous can be seen on the grounds, along with the elderly and young. It is not an uncommon sight to run into another person when exploring any of the buildings on the 368-acre-long campus. But the person you encounter is not always another keen explorer or juvenile graffiti artist. As cops have been known to frequently patrol within buildings № #93 and № #7, handing out tickets to whoever is unlucky enough to encounter them.</p>

<p>On August 25, 1988, the state-run Office of Mental Health would declare an overcrowding crisis within hospitals and psychiatric centers alike. Patients are laid on beds that are hardly even inches from one another, to them, it is degrading and to the staff a logistical nightmare. Due to the overflowing number of patients being received, many are carted off to other state-run facilities for treatment.</p>

<p>Many would see the monolithic 159-foot structure known as building No. 93 as they undergo the process of institutionalization, afterwards they would find residence on the active floors. Despite having 13 floors, only a third of them were in use; the remaining 2/3 had been closed off since the 1970s. In 1996, the entirety of the building, along with many others on the grounds, would lock their doors permanently. Some buildings would still operate afterward; building No. 7 would receive electricity until 2001, and building No. 1 served as an administrative office until 2012.</p>

<p>Post-abandonment the campus became the subject of heated controversy over its future. The Kings Park question is a dividing one, what should be done with such a large derelict facility?</p>

<p>Historians advocate for the preservation of the buildings on site that have not been razed, based mainly on the historical significance that some of the buildings hold. Many were constructed during the turn of the 20th century, yet this among many other facts is ignored by the state of New York Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation. The state, which runs the park had revitalized the waterfront with their Local Waterfront Revitalization Program, yet they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id-6hdid0-4">demolished 16 buildings and structures</a>. Glancing over the whole "protect, restore, and rehabilitate locally significant historic sites in the Sunken Meadow State Park and the Kings Park Psychiatric Center."</p>

<p>Others view the buildings as a blight upon the Kings Park community, polluting the park that it occupies. Razing them would open a new chapter of history within the town. Many could be hired to partake in the razing of the buildings, and new commercial buildings could take their space. In 2005 the property had a pending sale to the Arker Companies of Woodmere, with a potential plan for residental condominums and. Reusing some of the former patient housing, No. 93, the quads had also been considered. This plan had only just remained that; a plan. As the residents and officals of this hamlet had little need for condominums nor the workforce that it would bring. <!-- refer to Ghostly Hospital Becomes a Live Issue article for the reasons behind the local oppostion -->
It could have been developed into the next community center, one in which electroshock therapy and lobotomies are relics of the past</p>

<p>Much of the buildings has already been lost to vandals rather than time, with this generation's graffiti covering the sea-foam green walls of No. 93. A couple of odd years ago, some individuals took up the duty of restoring one of the 9th-floor rooms. The reason for it being that it would serve as an art installation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJC5xfj7iMg">exhibit № #8.</a> The room would still see a fresh new coat of white paint and furniture. In the door-frame had once stood a desk, on which you could leave your signature in a guest book. Sadly enough, the sweat put into this art project had been squandered by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLyqVnzDo2g">miscreants</a>; the once-white walls smothered by ash. </p>
