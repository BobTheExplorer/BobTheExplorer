<p>Down an inconspicuous street surrounded by water are the shuttered ruins of an upscale restaurant. Judging from its exterior you could say that it has been closed no longer than let's say about three years or so. Treading inside transports you to what used to be considered a high-class dining spot for the upper middle class.</p>

<figcaption>The upper-level dining hall that doubled as a wedding venue in its current state.</figcaption>   
</figure>
<p>Initially, this restaurant was one of the most prestigious ones that you could not only dine at but also within full view of the Midtown Manhattan skyline. A formal, comfortable setting with modest wine and dishes cooked by a French-trained chef.</p>
<br>
<p>Its ideal position made it the perfect location to host weddings and banquets; the second floor is well suited for such a momentous occasion. Two years after its opened in 1983, it hosted the wedding reception of Billy Joel and his then-wife, Christie Brinkley. Suffice it to say, this and multiple other factors, such as the great venue space, helped mark this eatery as one of the most iconic in the area.</p>

</figure>
<p>As the 2000s started to rear its head around the corner, its owners, the Somersteins, were embroiled in legal issues. Filing false reports, mail fraud, and defrauding employee benefits are just a couple of crimes that they played a hand in. Under tense scrutiny they pressed forward, purchasing a 90-foot rentable yacht that was moored next to the restaurant in 1999. Eventually, all of these scandals took their toll on the couple, pawning the place in 2008 off to its second owner, Harendra Singh.</p>
<br>
<p>This change in ownership only marginally affected the quality of service and food until it came to an abrupt end on October 30th, 2015. To the dismay of many, this meant trouble for those who booked the venue for their wedding. A single sign was posted on the door, letting any patrons or passersby know that it was closed for renovations, though this was a lie to save face.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Harendra Singh, was inundated with legal trouble much like his predecessors. Unlike the Somersteins, he was arrested and charged with corruption. The more time he marinated in federal custody, the more willing he became to cooperate with the authorities. He provided loads of information regarding the previous mayor, Bill DeBlasio's, fundraising campaign and the hand he played in it.</p>

<p>Since 2010, Mr. Singh has contributed much to DeBlasio's campaign, donating a total of $33,000. He even went as far as to hold a fund-raiser within these very halls. Why? Simply because he was trying to get on the future mayor's good side. Since he took over, he had constantly entered into disputes with the city over the lease and its renewal.</p>
<br>
<p>An audit later revealed he only paid a small percentage of rent, owing just about $1.2 million in debt. It appears all of his efforts were in vain due to the cutthroat nature of politics; no aid or remorse was given when he was ordered to pay $3.4 million in charges related to the neighboring pier that was included with the lease.</p>
<br>
<p>Now it sullenly lays fenced off to all, and in a twist of irony, the pier that Mr. Singh refused to pay for has become a destination for wedding photos. Many grooms and their brides now pass by completely unaware that past its concrete and glass exterior sits what used to be an elegant venue for weddings.</p>
