<p>Ask any New Yorker to list all the airports in the city, and they'll tell you two: JFK and LaGuardia. Unaware of the cities lesser known airports that remain out of the public eye. Inside of Flushing there used to be an <a href="https://forgotten-ny.com/1999/07/flushing-airport-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abandoned airport</a>; empty hangars and a rusted firetruck were all that was left of its previous life as one. Due to its location, everything previously listed has sunk into the marshy land. The only other airport that still stands is Floyd Bennett Field.</p>

<p>Neighboring the dirtiest beach in the area (Dead Horse Bay) is the site of Floyd Bennett Field. The asphalt runways have begun to falter under the pressure of time. Unsuitable for any plane to take off on but rather more suitable for doing donuts and barreling down it at 70mph. All of those who seem to visit are unaware how significant this site is in the history of aviation. Here the first ever man to fly across the North Pole launched off from, revolutionary pilot Floyd Bennett. </p>

<!--
<p>Far from the sports center and from the prying eyes of the public is the south administrative area. Characterized by the overabundance of military-built structures and housing, the soldiers who once lived here have long since left, but the buildings remain.</p> Battered army barracks built and used during the second World War stand resilently, the glass in their windows have since broken. insert something about how it looks like creedmoor and some historical data. </p>

<p> In 1971, the Navy withdrew its operations and decommissioned the Naval Air Station present within the airfield. A chunk of the buildings were boarded up and forgotten about, except for training exercises performed by the Coast Guard and the NYPD. While everything stood still, talks between the city and federal agencies fired up about the future of this site. After a year, the paperwork was finalized and the grounds were transferred over to the National Park Service administration. </p>

<p>Soon after, the officials in charge of reorienting the area focused more on nature and the wildlife on the island. After decades of military use, this task seemed more of a challenge than it was thought to be. Various pieces of infrastructure built by the Navy, Marines, and Army remain present. Most of these structures were ill suited for any civilian purpose, with the large majority of them being razed. The very few that were suitable were pressed into various types of use.</p>

<p>The World War II-era recreation building for enlisted men was transformed into an academic center, in preperation for this extensive alterations were done to it. New windows were added, but the core structure of the building remained the same: a large gym with two wings used for schoolrooms. The background of this school is quite shrouded in mystery, as there is little to no online documentation covering when it opened, closed, or even its name. Despite this setback, an educated guess can be made about the years it operated. On the first floor, there are a variety of blank scantrons spread out on the linoleum flooring, meaning that the school must have been in session during the late 1990s to early 2000s.</p>

<p>Another building of previous military origin converted for civilian use was the former practice bomb storage house. Rather than inert bombs the shelfs are racked with canoes, row boats, and an entire boat tucked away in a corner. All of this once belonged to Beach Channel High School rowing team, supposedly they were one of the only ones in whole city who took part in this sport. By 2014 the school shutdown and its last class had graduated. </p>
