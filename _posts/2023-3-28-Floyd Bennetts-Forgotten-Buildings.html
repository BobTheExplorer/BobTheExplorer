<p>Ask any New Yorker to list all the airports in the city, and they'll tell you two: JFK and LaGuardia. Unaware of the cities lesser known airports that remain out of the public eye. Inside of Flushing there used to be an <a href="https://forgotten-ny.com/1999/07/flushing-airport-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abandoned airport</a>; empty hangars and a rusted firetruck were all that was left of its previous life as one. Due to its location, everything previously listed has sunk into the marshy land. The only other airport that still stands is Floyd Bennett Field.</p>

<p>Neighboring the dirtiest beach in the area (Dead Horse Bay) is the site of Floyd Bennett Field. The asphalt runways have begun to falter under the pressure of time. Unsuitable for any plane to take off on but rather more suitable for doing donuts and barreling down it at 70mph. All of those who seem to visit are unaware how significant this site is in the history of aviation.</p>

<p>Despite the fact you'll never see any planes flying off the tarmac, it is still the first airport in New York. Its namesake is based on revolutionary pilot Floyd Bennett. The first ever man to fly across the North Pole launched off from this very airfield, which was known as Barren Island Airport at the time.</p>

<p>Far from the sports center and from the prying eyes of the public is the south administrative area. Characterized by the overabundance of military-built structures and housing, the soldiers who once lived here have long since left, but the buildings remain.</p>

In 1971, the Navy withdrew its operations and decommissioned the Naval Air Station present within the airfield. A chunk of the buildings were boarded up and forgotten about, except for a few which were to be used by the Coast Guard and the NYPD. While everything stood still, talks between the city and federal agencies fired up about the future of this site. A year later in the fall the grounds were transferred over to the National Park Service administration, which were used for the newly created Gateway National Urban Recreation Center.
