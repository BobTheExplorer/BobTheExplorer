That is the correct response, but many of the city's older airports remain out of the public eye. Inside of Flushing there used to be an abandoned airport; empty hangars and a rusted firetruck were all that was left of its previous life as one. Due to its location, everything previously listed has either been demolished or sunk into the marshy parcel of land. The only other former airport that still stands is Floyd Bennett Field."

<p>Ask any New Yorker to list all the airports in the city, and they'll tell you two: JFK and LaGuardia. That is the correct response, but many of the city's older airports remain out of the public eye. Inside of Flushing there used to be an <a href="https://forgotten-ny.com/1999/07/flushing-airport-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abandoned airport</a>; empty hangars and a rusted firetruck were all that was left of its previous life as one.
