<p> Inside of Flushing lies an unusual brick building surrounded by residential housing complexes. From the street, one can observe the various pieces of graffiti that are spread liberally across its facade. It is evident that it has been forgotten for a long time, by both the public and urban explorers alike. Had it not been for the large sign labeled "Flushing Hospital Medical Center North Division" one could never attribute this hospital as anything but an eyesore for the neighborhood. </p>
