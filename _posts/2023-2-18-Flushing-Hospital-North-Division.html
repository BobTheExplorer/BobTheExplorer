<p> Inside of Flushing lies an unusual building surrounded by residential housing complexes. From the street, one can observe the various pieces of graffiti  spread liberally across its facade. Had it not been for the large sign labeled "Flushing Hospital Medical Center North Division" one could never attribute this hospital as anything but an eyesore for the neighborhood. </p>

<p> Beyond its brick walls is a maze of tight corridors and turns, with areas that highlight the full brunt of decay. Light fixtures hang by a thread in parts ravaged by the elements and possibly by man. The painted walls have undergone the process of peeling off, and its paint chips have mixed into the already muddled flooring. With such a high level of decrepitness, it is hard to believe that patients once resided within these very same rooms. </p>
  










<!--
Phrases to incorperate into the writing:
- Since its closure in 1998, the only patients that are capable of residing within its walls are the local racoon population.
- To think that a place created with the sole purpose of hospitable has become anything but that.
