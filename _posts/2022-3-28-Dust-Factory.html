Overnight, the natural cement industry would quickly fall off in the number of factories producing it within the Lower Albany area. With the advent of Portland Cement, a man-made concoction of limestone and clay. By the 1890s, its cost would be significantly lower than the price of natural cement. Its potential would lure investors from the surrounding Hudson River area and from abroad. A further 12 years onward would see a German-owned cement firm set up a large, sprawling industrial complex in the area. Smoke would doter the area from the 16 smokestacks that would watch overall. The cement plant had been among four of the leading cement suppliers that would dominate the Hudson Valley. Seemingly, this success would be short-lived as America declared war on Germany and its allies.

Operations would completely cease as the U.S. government would declare it an enemy-owned property. From there on, ownership would change hands multiple times, with each owner being as unsuccessful as the last. The last owner would sell it to another large Portland cement company in 1937, waking it from its brief slumber. Though only for a limited time as one of the worst economic global disasters, The Great Depression, would occur. As a result of this, it would be once again closed until the February of 1940.

The following year on November 26th, a crash would be heard all across the Hudson valley. Twenty cement silos would collapse, polluting the area with cement that had an estimate value of $1,000,000. Construction work local to the area had been buried underneath a layer of debris, additionally 15 trucks carrying cement were overturned and flattened. Signs of a disaster occurring would come earlier that morning, as one of the water mains would shatter causing the silos to crack. Furthermore, the grounds that they were situated on had begun to settle, causing instability within the structure. Despite this turn of events, 60 percent of the cement had been salvaged.

Some moderate success would be seen as another world war would be waged overseas in the heartland of Europe and Asia. By the mid 1950s, the demand for cement had reached an all-time peak. New highways would be constructed across the nation, and homes for the returning valiant soldiers. Such demands would call for an expansion of the facilities. February 12th, 1959 about $8,000,000 would be spent on the construction of a kiln, a finishing mill, and twenty silos that could hold up to ten thousand barrels of cement.
