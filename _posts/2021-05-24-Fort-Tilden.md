What’s the NYC Goss
Yo check out this dog who ran free and spent ten hours exploring subway tunnels. My kinda puffball.

The NYC Subway system is now open again 24-7 though really that never mattered to explorers and graffiti artists. We own the damn place whatever hour we want.

Metro North has finally gotten the go-ahead to build stations in the Bronx and access Penn Station via Hell Gate Bridge. The existing tracks belong to Amtrak, but they don’t feature any local stops. The increase in train traffic over Hell Gate will add a small layer of complexity to the long hike to the main span…

Shorty’s Short Shorts:
Texas is, uh, different. A long abandoned nursing home there is going to be demolished, and a local news crew went inside to shoot footage for their story. The footage is awesome—complete with penis scrawls on chairs, incredibly bad graffiti (that “Ghost” is next level bad), and can you spot the actual loot? Texans might be OK at BBQ but they just don’t know how to properly scrap out and loot a buildings.

The old jail in Augusta is slated for demolition. Too bad they won’t be demolishing it with all the governor and his racist new voting policies inside.

A Minneapolis teen was injured while exploring the apparently cursed Fruen Mill site, where numerous other injuries and at least one death have taken place over the last two decades. No word on what his Insta is, or if he at least got some great sock boy sponsorship photos. #DoItForTheSocks

Detained migrants in Australia started tunneling their way out of a detention facility and given how many man-made tunnels there are at the US/Mexico border, I’d bet it’s just a matter of time before this happens here.

Speaking of man-made tunnels, The Israeli military lied about a land invasion of Gaza last week in order to entrap Hamas fighters in a rudimentary tunnel system which they then bombarded from the air. The story begs the question of how many secret tunnels are under Gaza? It’s safe to assume “a lot”, though I doubt anyone other than Hamas members will be exploring them anytime in our lifetime—and that sucks. I’d bet a nickel they have a tunnel network that rivals the catacombs of Paris.
