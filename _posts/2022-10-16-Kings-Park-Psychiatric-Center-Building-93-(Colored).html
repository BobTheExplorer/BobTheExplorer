<p>When the thought of abandoned or, dare I say, haunted psychiatric centers comes to mind, most think of the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center (KPPC). Even those who do not consider themselves all that adventurous can be seen on the grounds, along with the elderly and young. It is not uncommon to run into another person when exploring any of the buildings on the 368-acre-long campus. When exploring the grounds, it is all too often that you forget about the history of this overflow facility.</p>

<p>On August 25, 1988, the state-run Office of Mental Health declared an overcrowding crisis within hospitals and psychiatric centers alike. Patients are laid on beds that are hardly even inches from one another; to them, it is degrading and to the staff a logistical nightmare. Due to the overwhelming number of patients being received, many are carted off to other state-run facilities for treatment.</p>
<br>
<p>Many would see the monolithic 159-foot structure known as building No. 93 as they underwent the process of institutionalization; afterwards, they sought residence on the active floors. Despite having 13 floors, only a third of them were in use; the remaining 2/3 have been closed off since the 1970s. In 1996, the entirety of the building along with many others on the grounds closed. Some buildings still operated afterwards; building No. 7 received electricity until 2001, and building No. 1 served as an administrative office until 2012. </p>

<p>Post-abandonment, the campus became the subject of heated controversy over its future. The Kings Park question is a dividing one: what should be done with such a sprawling derelict facility?</p>
<br>
<p>Historians advocate for the preservation of the buildings that have yet to be razed, based mainly on the historical significance that some of the buildings hold. Many were constructed during the turn of the 20th century, and yet this among many other facts is ignored by the Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation. They had revitalized the waterfront with their Local Waterfront Revitalization Program, yet they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id-6hdid0-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demolished 16 buildings and structures</a>. Glancing over the whole "<strong>protect, restore, and rehabilitate locally significant historic sites in the Sunken Meadow State Park and the Kings Park Psychiatric Center.</strong>"</p>
<br>
<p>Others view the buildings as a blight upon the Kings Park community, polluting the park that it occupies. Razing them opened a new chapter in the history of the town. In 2005, the property had a pending sale to the Arker Companies of Woodmere, with a potential plan for residential condominiums. Reusing some of the former patient housing (No. 93, the quads) was also considered. This plan had only just remained that; a plan. The residents and officials of the hamlet saw no need for condominiums or the influx of people it could bring. If they went through with it, it could have been developed into a community center, one in which electroshock therapy and lobotomies are relics of the past.</p>

<p>Many of the buildings have already been lost to vandals rather than time, with this generation's graffiti covering the mustard-yellow walls of No. 93. A couple of odd years ago, some individuals took up the duty of restoring one of the 9th-floor rooms. A fresh new coat of white paint replaced the peeling paint of the past; a bed and other amenities were added. In the doorframe stood a desk, on which you could leave your signature in a guest book. This reverse vandalism guerrilla art installation would be known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJC5xfj7iMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exhibit No. 8.</a>  Sadly enough, the sweat put into this art project was squandered by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLyqVnzDo2g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miscreants</a>; the once-white walls smothered by ash. </p>

<p>All is not lost, even if it seems that the buildings are in peril of getting trashed even further. There are still <a href="/assets/images/KPPC93/Food Service Policy & Procedure_compressed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artifacts</a> and other remnants that show what life must have been like for patients and staff at this facility. Patient beds line the basement floor of building No. 93 (pictured above), and <a href="/assets/images/KPPC93/DietaryProfile.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietary-related documents</a> are strewn about the kitchen of building No. 138. But we can only hope that it stays that way. </p>
