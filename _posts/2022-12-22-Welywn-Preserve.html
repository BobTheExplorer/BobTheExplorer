<p> Surely most people have read the 1925 novel The Great Gatsby, penned by no one else but F. Scott Fitzgerald. Lavish parties the likes of which the common man will never experience. Despite the novel being fiction, certain aspects of the novel are drawn from reality, such as the location of the mansions. Long Island, or to be more exact, Glen Cove, is a city within Nassau County and a hotbed for these old money types. </p>

<p>insert history behind Pratt and some facts of how he created the estate, mention the pratt oval</p>

<p>The Pratt Estate was condemned then purchased by Nassau County in first few months of 1975. The acquisition of the land had long been anticipated, considering that various plans and proposals had been plotted years before the 3-4 million-dollar purchase. One of these plans included turning the premises into a "sanitary" landfill to quell the overflow of trash within the city of Glen Cove. Most residents opposed the improper use of the land, with about 200 of them appeared before the City Council on February 8th, 1972. Another included the construction of 294 condominiums that occupied most of the space on the 212-acre property. Talks between the developer of this plan, Barton A. Forbes, and the then mayor at the time, Vincent A. Suozzi, bore no fruit. </p>

<p>Various buildings across the site served different purposes; the magnificent manor house hosted wine-tasting parties, science fairs, art exhibits, and film productions. Beginning in 1983, the Nassau County Sheriff's Department selected Welywn as a training site. Signs of this are still present within the greenhouses, where mock jail cells sit within the cavernous basements. </p>

<p>"Welwyn" is the Anglo-Saxon word for "welcome"</p>
