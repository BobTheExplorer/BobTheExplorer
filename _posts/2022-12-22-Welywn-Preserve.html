<p> Surely most people have read the 1925 novel The Great Gatsby, penned by no one else but F. Scott Fitzgerald. Lavish parties the likes of which the common man will never experience. Despite the novel being fiction, certain aspects of the novel are drawn from reality such as the location of the mansions. Long Island, or to be more exact, Glen Cove, is a city within Nassau County and a hotbed for these old money types. </p>


<p>The Pratt Estate was condemned and purchased by Nassau County sometime between 1974 and the first few months of the new year. The acquisition of the land had long been anticipated, considering that various plans and proposals had been plotted years before the 3-4 million-dollar purchase. One of these plans included turning the premises into a "sanitary" landfill so as to quell the overflow of trash within the city of Glen Cove. Most residents opposed the improper use of the Pratt estate, with about 200 of them appearing before the City Council on February 8th, 1972. Another included the construction of 294 condominiums that would take up most of the space on the 212-acre property. Talks between the developer of this plan, Barton A. Forbes, and the then mayor at the time, Vincent A. Suozzi, bore no fruit. </p>

<p>Various buildings across the site served different uses; the magnificent manor house hosted wine-tasting parties, science fairs, art exhibits, and film productions. Beginning in 1983, the Nassau County Sheriffs department would select Welywn as a training site. Signs of this are still present within the greenhouses, where mock jail cells sit within the cavernous basements. </p>
