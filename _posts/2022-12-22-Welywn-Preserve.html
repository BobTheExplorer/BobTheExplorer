<p> Surely most have read the 1925 novel <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, penned by no one else but F. Scott Fitzgerald. Lavish parties the likes of which the common man will never experience. Despite the novel being fiction, certain aspects of the novel are drawn from reality, such as the location of the mansions. Long Island, or to be more exact, Glen Cove, is a city embedded in Nassau County and a hotbed for these old money types. </p>

<p>insert history behind Pratt and some facts of how he created the estate, mention the pratt oval</p>

<p> The Pratt Estate was condemned then purchased by Nassau County in first few months of 1975. The acquisition of the land had long been anticipated, considering that various plans and proposals had been plotted years before the 3-4 million-dollar purchase. One such plan included turning the premises into a "sanitary" landfill to quell the overflow of trash in Glen Cove. Most residents opposed this improper use of the premises, with about 200 of them appearing before the City Council on February 8th, 1972. Another included the construction of 294 condominiums that occupied most of the space on the 212-acre property. Talks between the developer of this plan, Barton A. Forbes, and the then mayor at the time, Vincent A. Suozzi, bore no fruit. </p>

<p> Inaction plagued the grounds until 1977, when the halls of Welwyn opened once more as a conference center. From there on, wine-tasting parties, science fairs, art exhibits, and even film productions were hosted inside its walls. Those very same walls were repaired in a series of renovations that occurred in 1993 to prepare for the opening of a Holocaust Memorial, which is still open to this day. It seems that for once a historic building was able to stave off abandonment, unlike the other structures on the property.</p>

<p> Nestled away from paved roads sits the pride of Ms. Pratt; the greenhouses. The glass roofing has long since been smashed and anything worth value has been stripped away. A lone cell door stands within the cavernous basement, dating back when the Nassau County Sheriff's Department used the area as a training site.</p>


<!--
  <p>Beginning in 1983, the Nassau County Sheriff's Department selected Welywn as a training site. Signs of this are still present within the greenhouses, where mock jail cells sit within the cavernous basements. </p>


<p>"Welwyn" is the Anglo-Saxon word for "welcome"</p>
