An unassuming diner on the corner of 49th Avenue and 21st Street seems out of the ordinary in the skyscraper-dominated area of Long Island City. Consider it a time capsule from 1954; faux leather booth seating, stainless-steel trimmings, marbled lunch counters, all the furnishings of a Mountain View Company-built diner. Classic menu items such as greasy cheeseburgers and somewhat stale coffee were served daily to patrons for 43 years until its closure in 1997.

Post-closure, it would be known by titles, correlating to who owned it at the time. To rattle off a few of these titles: Ocean Diner, The Golden Fountain, Skyline Diner, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110430171717/http://www.mwellsdiner.com/">Magasin Wells Diner</a>. The latter had been the most successful in comparison to previous reopenings, serving dishes of Quebec-regional cuisine. In a response to lack of business or a rent increase, the owners would hold their last lunch service sometime between the 1st and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111127155200/http://mwellsdiner.com:80/">27th of September 2011</a>. Relocating their place of business elsewhere, handing off the former diner to the next-door Adelfia Bar & Grill.

At the time of purchase, the bar had been undergoing renovations of its own. So would the diner, mainly to blend the aesthetics of both buildings. Stripping the <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/3033/2768446768_83964a6ac4_o.jpg">red Blue Sky banner that wrapped around the exterior</a> into a striped black-and-white pattern. Further work would be renovating the interior, removing the patterned titles in favor of desaturating everything in an off-white. For some reason, unbeknownst to the public, construction work at the site would be halted in 2013. The remnants of a failed renovation remain, as boxes weighed with construction materials occupy part of the space.
