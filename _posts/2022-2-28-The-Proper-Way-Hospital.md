excerpt: "One of Queens only private hospitals shuttered"

Somewhere in the borough of Queens lays The Parkway Hospital, a one hundred bed health care facility that had been sheltered during the 2008 recession. It had been among eight other hospitals that had closed that year due to the New York City Regional Advisory Committee. This committee had been headed by one, Steven Berger and aided by then current Governor of state, George Pataki. The goal of this Berger Committee had been to evaluate hospitals across the state of New York, improve the level of quality in hospitals, and restructure and rightsize the hospital system. A solid plan on paper, it falters when rightsizing translates to shutting down various hospitals across the state during one of the worst recessions in recent history.
