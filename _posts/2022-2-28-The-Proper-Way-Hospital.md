In 2008 various hospitals and medical institutions across New York state had to lock up their doors amidst a global reccession. The decision to close them had been made by the New York State Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century, which had been created to review medical complexes and to improve them. However, due to ever increasing costs of mananging them had led to the state pressuring hospitals to either merge with nearby hospitals or to reduce the amount of beds. Those who would not comply the orders of the comission could have their medical certificate revoked.

As a result five hospitals within New York city would close without question that year, Saint Vincent's Midtown Hospital, Cabrini Medical Center, Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn, New York Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx, and Proper Way Hospital. TA 250 bed facility with a predominantly elderly population that had been the only privately owned facility within the Queens at the time.
