In 2008 various hospitals and medical institutions across New York state had to lock up their doors amidst a global reccession. The decision to close them had been made by the New York State Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century, which had been created to review medical complexes and to improve them. However, due to ever increasing costs of mananging them had led to the state pressuring hospitals to either merge with nearby hospitals or to reduce the amount of beds. Those who would not comply the orders of the comission could have their medical certificate revoked.

As a result five hospitals within New York city would close without question that year, Saint Vincent's Midtown Hospital, Cabrini Medical Center, Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn, New York Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx, and Proper Way Hospital. A 250 bed privately owned facility within Queens with a predominantly elderly population. 

Prior to its closure the hospital would face multiple lawsuits by the federal government and adovacy groups. July 17th 2001 would be the date that The State Health Department would fine them $32,000 for failing to apprehend two urologists from planning and preforming prostate surgeries on men who rescided at Proper Way. Later investigation into the case would reveal the none of the surgeries were needed. Three years later the hospital would have agree to aid deaf patients after being neglected. One such case would be Sarah Posner, aged 77 whose only means of communication was notes and a staff therapist with a limited knowledge of sign language. Her and others poor treatment would install led the hospital to install an audio-visual interperation system, a supply of interpreters, and to pay a sum of $125,000 to an undisclosed family of a deaf patient.
