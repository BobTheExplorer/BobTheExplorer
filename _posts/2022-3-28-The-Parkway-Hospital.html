<p>In 2008, various hospitals and medical institutions across New York State were forced to lock up their doors amidst a global recession. The decision to close them was made by the New York State Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century, created to review medical complexes and improve them. However, due to the ever-increasing cost of managing them, the state had been pressuring hospitals to either merge with nearby hospitals or reduce the number of beds. Those who did not comply with the orders of the commission could have their medical certificates revoked.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left">As a result, five hospitals within New York City closed without question that year: Saint Vincent's Midtown Hospital, Cabrini Medical Center, Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn, New York Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx, and the Parkway Hospital in Queens. An 250-bed privately owned facility within Queens with a predominantly elderly population.</p>

<p>Prior to its state-mandated closure, the hospital faced multiple lawsuits by the federal government and advocacy groups. On July 17th, 2001, the State Health Department fined them $32,000 for failing to apprehend two urologists who were planning and performing prostate surgeries on elderly male patients. Later investigation into the case revealed that none of the surgeries were required.</p>
<br>
<p>3 years later, the hospital agreed to aid deaf patients after being neglected. One such case is that of Sarah Posner, aged 77, whose only means of communication were notes and a staff therapist with limited knowledge of sign language. Her poor treatment led to the hospital installing an audio-visual interpretation system, a supply of interpreters, and to pay a sum of $125,000 to an undisclosed patient.</p>

<p>The poor quality of care eventually led to a change in management in the sweltering summer of  2004. Under this new management came new additions: two hyperbaric chambers, a sleep laboratory, and a wound care center. This change in management lasted only a short time, as one year afterward, the hospital filed for bankruptcy and for Chapter 11 protection with $29 million in assets and liabilities. Declaring bankruptcy with millions of dollars in assets had marked the decline of Parkway, though another significant blow came in 2006 when a state-run health commission recommended the hospital cease all operations.</p>

<p>With the state recommending its closure, many assumed that Parkway was soon to close that year. Despite the popular belief that it was closed, officials attempted to dispel this rumor. As ambulances were redirected away, many doctors and their patients were confused as to whether the hospital had officially ceased all operations. Regardless, its doors were sealed sometime in September of 2008.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left">In June of 2009, it would once again attempt to reopen, but a federal judge dismissed it. Afterwards, a plan to reuse the former health care facility as a detention center arose. Much to the chagrin of the surrounding community, which is understandable given the proximity of four nearby schools.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left">No one would step foot inside for a while, that is until access to the building was found. Entering the building was as easy as walking straight into the main entrance, which brought hordes of local explorers and juveniles. Copper thieves took to collecting copper from the basement and its sub-level. One daring individual decided to take up the task of scorching a bed in the emergency room on the second floor. With the influx of activity going on inside, the jig was up. All and any possible entrances were boarded up, along with a security guard posted in the back parking lot.</p>

<p>As of a year ago, the property was bought by Madison Realty Capital Originates to redevelop the former health care facility and its surroundings into residential housing. Though nothing has been done with the property, possibly due to the ongoing construction of a building that borders Parkway.</p>
