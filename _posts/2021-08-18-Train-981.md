 Not too far away from the Montauk Cutoff lays an old LIRR train that time forgot, but certaintly not the graffiti artists of the Long Island City. Not all too much is known about it, the advertisements seem to be dated back to the early 2000s. Originally it consisted of ten train cars, eight of them had been sent to scrapyard in Ohio around 2018.
