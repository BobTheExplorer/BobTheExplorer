Overnight, the natural cement industry would quickly fall off in the number of factories producing it within the Lower Albany area. The advent of Portland Cement, a man-made concoction of limestone and clay, by the eighteen-nineties, its cost would be significantly lower than the price of natural cement. Its potential would lure investors from the surrounding Hudson River area and from abroad. A further twelve years onward would see a German-owned cement firm set up a large, sprawling industrial complex in the area. Smoke would doter the area from the sixteen large smokestacks that would watch overall. The cement plant had been among four of the leading cement suppliers that would dominate the Hudson Valley. Seemingly, this success would be short-lived as soon as America declared war on the Triple Alliance powers.

Operations would completely cease as the government would declare it an enemy-owned property. From there on, ownership would change hands multiple times, with each owner being as unsuccessful as the last. The last owner would sell it to another large Portland cement company in nineteen-twenty-five, waking it from its brief slumber. Though only for a short time as one of the worst economic global disasters, The Great Depression, would occur. As a result of this, it would be once again closed until nineteen-thirty-nine. It would see some moderate success as another world war would be waged overseas in the heartland of Europe and Asia. By the nineteen-fifties, the demand for cement would reach an all-time peak. New highways would be constructed across the nation, and homes for the returning valiant soldiers would be built. So much so that on February twelveth, nineteen-fifty-nine about eight million dollars would be spent on the construction of a, kiln, a finishing mill, and twenty silos that could hold up to ten thousand barrels of cement.
