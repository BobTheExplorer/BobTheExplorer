The advent of Portland Cement, a man-made concoction of limestone and clay. By the eighteen-nineties, its cost would be significantly lower than the price of natural cement. Its potential would lure investors from the surrounding Hudson River area and from abroad. A further twelve years onward would see a German-owned cement firm set up a large, sprawling industrial complex in the area. Smoke would doter the area from the sixteen large smokestacks that would watch overall. The cement plant had been among four of the leading cement suppliers that would dominate the Hudson Valley.

Operations would completely cease as the government would declare it an enemy-owned property. From there on, ownership would change hands multiple times, with each owner being as unsuccessful as the last.

Additional buildings would be constructed on the property, and the ones before them would be painted with new layers of reinforced concrete.
