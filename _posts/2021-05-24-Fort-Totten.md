Willets farmhouse had been constructed in 1829 in a Greek Revival style, and is currently the oldest surviving structure at Fort Totten. It's existance predates the construction of the fort itself, it wasn't until the Goverment bought the land that the house came to be in it's current location. It's original location had been in the uppermost part of the penisula, so it would remain being used as engineers office for the Army Corps of Engineers. That is until 1867 where under orders of General Duane that it would be moved to current relocation and be remodeled. It would would serve as dwelling for the officer in charge of the fort, it's Greek revival style would be changed into a then fashionable Gothic Revival style. Then it would see the Abbot family move into the house until it would be surpassed by the creation of commanding officer's quarters in 1909. Despite this it would see another change, as in 1940 the single family house would be converted into a two family house. It would be abandoned shortly after this, now it lays fallow. Perhaps it would be renovated once again by the Bayside Historic Society that occupies a neighborhing house
