<p>
The smell of freshly made hot coffee and pancakes, the sounds of silverware clanking, and the sight of packed tables have all but dissipated. The Blue Sky diner seems to be out of the ordinary in the skyscraper-dominated area of Long Island City. Consider the diner a time capsule of sorts; faux leather booth seating, stainless steel trimming, and all the furnishings of a Mountain View built diner.
