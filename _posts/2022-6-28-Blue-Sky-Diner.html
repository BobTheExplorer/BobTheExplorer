An unassuming diner on the corner of 49th Avenue and 21st Street seems out of the ordinary in the skyscraper-dominated area of Long Island City. Consider it a time capsule from 1954; faux leather booth seating, stainless-steel trimmings, marbled lunch counters, and all the furnishings of a Mountain View Company-built diner. Classic menu items such as greasy cheeseburgers and somewhat stale coffee would be served daily to patrons for 43 years until it's closure in 1997.

Post-closure the it be would known as several different names correlating to who owned it at the time. To rattle off a few, Ocean diner, The Golden Fountain, Skyline diner, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110430171717/http://www.mwellsdiner.com/"> Magasin Wells Diner</a>. The latter being the most successful in comparsion to the its previous reopenings, dishing out Quebecois food.
