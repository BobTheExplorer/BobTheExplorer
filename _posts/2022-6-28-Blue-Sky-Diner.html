An unassuming diner on the corner of 49th Avenue and 21st Street seems out of the ordinary in the skyscraper-dominated area of Long Island City. Consider it a time capsule from 1954; faux leather booth seating, stainless-steel trimmings, marbled lunch counters, and all the furnishings of a Mountain View Company-built diner. Classic menu items such as greasy cheeseburgers and somewhat stale coffee would be served daily to patrons for 43 years until it's closure in 1997.

Though before it's closure director, Jonathan Nossiter would shoot a couple scenes for his independent film, Sunday.
