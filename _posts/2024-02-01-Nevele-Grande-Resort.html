<p>The future for Nevele remains one that is unknown to the general public, but we can theorize at the very least. The most prominent one amongst online circles is that the construction will never begin, owing to the bald eagle nest located near the swimming pool. Not only that, during strains or heavy bouts of rain, the area floods a significant amount. It is most likely that the hotel will endure the brunt of time until a time far from now.</p>
