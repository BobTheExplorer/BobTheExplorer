<p>Much like many other resorts within the Borsch Belt, the Nevele started off as a small family-run hotel. Opened in 1901, initially as a country club, it would quickly grow into a resort by the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

<p>Around the late 1970s to early 1980s, most of these resorts and the towns they resided in started to stagnate, with the majority of them closing indefinitely. The main reason: a loss of their original predominately Jewish customer base.</p> 
<br>
<p>The Nevele was not spared in this regard, as it contentiously struggled to remain relevant. In the early 1990s, there was an attempt to cater to large-scale companies. Certain areas were leased out to mainly corporations for work-specific conventions, which provided a mild success for the aging resort.</p>

<p>Perhaps through a premonition or just common sense, the Slutskies pawned off the resort in 1997. Fred Kassner, co-founder of Liberty Travel, acquired the 800-acre resort and country club for $10 million.</p> 
<br>
<p>The passing of ownership was albeit short, considering that the new owner passed away in 1998. Afterwards, the property fell into the hands of Stratford Business Corp. for $415 million in 2000. Over the span of the next 3 years, $11 million would be spent on modernizing it.</p>

<p>By 2006, the guest rooms and other faculties were starting to show their age. An overwhelming smell of mold along with mildew was present throughout the premises. Even before its eventual closure, it was already severely dilapidated.</p>

<p>As the effects of the 2008 economic recession began to be felt across America, the resort was in deep financial straits. In the sweltering heat of summer, it owed more than $700,000 in taxes to Ulster County. In March, a balance of $35,277 was to be paid out after an employee was injured on the clock.</p>

<p>Post-closure, the pressure continued to build. An unpaid debt of $293,826 was owed in water, gas, and electric fees alone. Evidently, it proved to be too much, so it was once again put up for sale. Surprisingly enough, the sale almost happened until a walk-through of the property was performed.</p>

<p>A renewed interest in the hotel occurred sometime in 2014. For a time, it was considered to be the site of a new casino. If this proposal came about, it could have revitalized the former Borscht-Belt-era resorts.</p> 

<p>Just a couple of months ago, there was yet another change in ownership. 1100 Arrow LLC, the new owners, bought it for an estimated $5 million last October. Part of the sale also included a plan to demolish the majority of the former resort for condominiums.</p>
