In 2008, various hospitals and medical institutions across New York state had to lock up their doors amidst a global recession. The decision to close them had been made by the New York State Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century, which had been created to review medical complexes and improve them. However, due to the ever increasing cost of managing them, had led to the state pressuring hospitals to either merge with nearby hospitals or reduce the number of beds. Those who do not comply with the orders of the commission could have their medical certificate revoked.

As a result, five hospitals within New York City would close without question that year, Saint Vincent's Midtown Hospital, Cabrini Medical Center, Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn, New York Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx, and Proper Way Hospital. A 250-bed privately owned facility within Queens with a predominantly elderly population.

Prior to its state mandated closure, the hospital faced multiple lawsuits by the federal government and advocacy groups. July 17th, 2001 would be the date that the State Health Department would fine them $32,000 for failing to apprehend two urologists from planning and performing prostate surgeries on men who resided at Proper Way. Later investigation into the case would reveal that none of the surgeries were needed. Three years later, the hospital agreed to aid deaf patients after being neglected. One such case would be Sarah Posner, aged 77, whose only means of communication were notes and a staff therapist with a limited knowledge of sign language. Her and others' poor treatment would lead the hospital to install an audio-visual interpretation system, a supply of interpreters, and to pay a sum of $125,000 to an undisclosed family of a deaf patient.

The poor quality of care would eventually lead to a change in management in the sweltering summer of July 2004. Under this new management would come new additions: two hyperbaric chambers, a sleep laboratory, and a wound care center. This would only last a short time, as one year afterward, the hospital would have to file for bankruptcy and would file for Chapter 11 protection with 29 million in assets and liabilities. Declaring bankruptcy with millions of assets had marked the decline of Proper Way, though another significant blow would come in 2006, when a state-run health commission recommended the hospital cease all operations.

With the state recommending it's closure, many had assumed that Proper Way was soon to close that year. Despite the popular belief that it was closed, officials would attempt to dispel this rumor. As ambulances were redirected away, many doctors and their patients were confused as to whether the hospital had officially ceased all operations. Regardless, it would shutter its doors sometime in September of 2008.

In the June of 2009 it would once again attempt to reopen but a federal judge would dismiss this. Afterwards a plan of reusing the former health care facility as detention center would arise. Much to the dismay of the surrounding community, understandable so as there is four schools within the its vicinity. 

No one would step foot into Proper way for awhile that is until access into the building had been found. With entering the building being as easy as walking straight into the main entrance it had brought hordes of local explorers and juveniles. Copper thieves had took to collect copper from the various mechanical equipment in the basement and its sub-level. One daring individual had took up the task of scorching a bed in the Emergency Room on the second floor. With the influx of activity going on inside, the jig was up. All and any possible entrances were boarded up, along with a security guard booth being posted in the back parking lot.

As of a year ago the property had been bought out by Madison Realty Capital Originates to redevelop the former health care facility and its surroundings into residental housing. All though nothing has been done with the property possibly due to the ongoing construction of a building that borders Proper Way.
