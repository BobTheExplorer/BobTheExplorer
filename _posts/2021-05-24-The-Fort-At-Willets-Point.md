So basically, urbex
<!-- The Willets farmhouse was constructed in 1829 in the Greek Revival style and is currently the oldest surviving structure at Fort Totten. Its existence predates the construction of the fort itself. It wasn't until the government bought the land that the house came to be at its current location. Its original location had been in the uppermost part of the peninsula, and so it would remain. It would then be used as an engineering office for the Army Corps of Engineers, until 1867. Under the orders of General Duane, it would be moved to its current location and be remodeled. It would be repurposed once again, serving as a dwelling for the officer in charge of the fort. Then it would see the Abbot family move into the house until it would be surpassed by the creation of the commanding officer's quarters in 1909. Despite this, it would see another alteration as in 1940 the single-family house would be converted into a two-family house. It would be abandoned shortly after this, now it lies fallow. Perhaps it will be renovated once again by the Bayside Historical Society which occupies a neighboring house. -->
