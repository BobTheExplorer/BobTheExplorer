 description: "Inside Flushing lies an unusual building surrounded by residential housing complexes. From the street, one can observe the various pieces of graffiti spread liberally across its façade. Had it not been for the large sign labeled “Flushing Hospital Medical Center North Division” one could never attribute this hospital as anything but an eyesore for the neighborhood."

<p> A twenty minute walk from Jacob Riis Park lies the former naval base and current National Park, Fort Tilden. The missiles and naval artillery were traded in for athletic fields, hiking trails for the adventurous, and a center for arts. Despite the old military weaponry being done away with, the historic buildings of the naval base remain to this very day.</p>
