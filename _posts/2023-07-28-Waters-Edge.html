<p>Down an inconspicuous street surrounded by water are the shuttered ruins of an upscale restaurant. Despite its abandoned status, there is very little to suggest that its windows are still in one piece, and neither has its exterior been covered with thick coats of graffiti. The only characteristic it shares with most abandoned buildings is the years-old chain-link fence that engulfs the former main entrance to the building.Â  </p>

<p>Initially, this restaurant was one of the most prestigious ones that you could not only dine at but also within full view of the Midtown Manhattan skyline. A formal, comfortable setting with modest wine and dishes cooked by a French-trained chef.</p>
<br>
<p>Its ideal position made it the perfect location to host weddings and banquets; the second floor is well suited for such a momentous occasion. Two years after its opening in 1983, it hosted the wedding reception of Billy Joel and his then-wife, Christie Brinkley. Suffice to say, this and multiple other factors, such as its great venue space, helped mark this eatery as one of the most iconic in the area.</p>

<p>As the 2000s started to rear its head around the corner, its owners, the Somersteins, were embroiled in legal issues. Filing false reports, mail fraud, and defrauding a employee benefits are just a couple of crimes that they played a hand in. Under tense scrutiny they pressed forward, purchasing a 90ft rentable yacht which was moored next to the restaurant in 1999. Eventually all of these scandals that they were involved in caught up to them, pawning the place in 2008 off to it second owner, Harendra Singh.</p>
<br>
<p>This change in ownership only marginally affected the quality of service and food at the restaurant until it came to an abrupt end on October 30th, 2015. To the dismay of many, this meant trouble for those who booked the venue for their wedding. A single sign was posted on the door, letting any patrons or passersby know that it's closed for renovations, though this was a lie to save face. </p>

<p>As it turns out the second owner, Harendra Singh, was inundated with legal trouble much like the previous owners. Unlike the Somersteins, he was arrested and charged with corruption. The more time he marinated in federal custody, the more willing he became to cooperate with the authorities. He provided information regarding the previous mayor, Bill DeBlasio's, fundraising campaign.</p>

<p>Collaboration and collusion with DeBlasio</p>

<p>End on how a place so elegant in its design could end up in such a disastrous state of ruin. </p>

<!-- 
Talk about how they messed up, the yatch, and then the selling of the eatery to its second owner.
Judging from its exterior, it seems more vacant rather than abandoned; you could honestly assume that it had shut down some time during the COVID pandemic. Turns out that ever since its owner was arrested in 2016 that this place has sat mostly untouched by man, the same cannot be said for the elements.
