<p>Down an inconspicuous street surrounded by water are the shuttered ruins of an upscale restaurant. Despite its abandoned status, there is very little to suggest that its windows are still in one piece, and neither has its exterior been covered with thick coats of graffiti. The only characteristic it shares with most abandoned buildings is the years-old chain-link fence that engulfs the former main entrance to the building.Â  </p>

<p>Initially, this restaurant was one of the most prestigious ones that you could not only dine at but also within full view of the Midtown Manhattan skyline. A formal, comfortable setting with modest wine and dishes cooked by a French-trained chef.</p>

<p>Its ideal position made it the perfect location to host weddings and banquets; the second floor is well suited for such a momentous occasion. Two years after its opening in 1983, it hosted the wedding reception of Billy Joel and his then-wife, Christie Brinkley. Suffice to say, this and many other factors, such as its location, helped mark this eatery as one of the most iconic in the area.</p>

<p>As the 2000s reared its head around the corner, its owners, the Somersteins, were embroiled in legal issues. Filing false reports, mail fraud, and defrauding a employee benefits are just a couple of crimes that they played a part in. Under tense legal scrutiny they pressed forward. </p>

Talk about how they messed up, the yatch, and then the selling of the eatery to its second owner.
Judging from its exterior, it seems more vacant rather than abandoned; you could honestly assume that it had shut down some time during the COVID pandemic. Turns out that ever since its owner was arrested in 2016 that this place has sat mostly untouched by man, the same cannot be said for the elements.
