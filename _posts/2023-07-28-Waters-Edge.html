<p>Down an inconspicuous street surrounded by water are the shuttered ruins of an upscale restaurant. Despite its abandoned status, there is very little to suggest that its windows are still in one piece, and neither has its exterior been covered with thick coats of graffiti. The only characteristic it shares with most abandoned buildings is the years-old chainlink fence that engulfs the former main entrance to the building.Â  </p>

<p>At one point in its 35-year lifespan, this restaurant was one of the most prestigious ones that you could not only dine at but also within full view of the Midtown Manhattan skyline. </p>
<!-- 
Judging from its exterior, it seems more vacant rather than abandoned; you could honestly assume that it had shut down some time during the COVID pandemic. Turns out that ever since its owner was arrested in 2016 that this place has sat mostly untouched by man, the same cannot be said for the elements.
