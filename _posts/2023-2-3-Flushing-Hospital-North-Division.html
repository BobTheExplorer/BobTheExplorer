<p> Inside Flushing lies an unusual building surrounded by residential housing complexes. From the street, one can observe the various pieces of graffiti spread liberally across its façade. Had it not been for the large sign labeled “<strong>Flushing Hospital Medical Center North Division</strong>” one could never attribute this hospital as anything but an eyesore for the neighborhood.</p>
<br>
<p> Beyond its brick exterior is a maze of tight corridors and turns, with areas that highlight the full brunt of decay. Light fixtures hang by a thread in parts ravaged by the elements and possibly by man. The painted walls have undergone the process of peeling off, and paint chips have mixed into the already muddled flooring. With such a high level of decrepitude, it is hard to believe that patients had once resided in these very same rooms. </p>

<p>Since it first opened its doors to the public in 1936 as a sanitarium and a hospital, it has been the subject of many lawsuits and cases of malpractice.</p>
<br>
<p> One of the earliest cases involved a 75-year-old man who sought aid for his bleeding penis. A two-stage prostatectomy was performed. Shortly after the first stage of the operation, he was assisted to the bathroom by a nurse. Inside, left unattended he slipped and fell with such a great force that his skull fractured upon the floor. During this, the attending nurse sat at a desk 20 feet away, unaware of what had transpired. After 20 grueling minutes, he managed to stumble his way outside the bathroom, only for not a single nurse to be in sight. On January 28, 1958, he succumbed to his wounds and died. </p>
<br>
<p>Another case was that of a 68-year-old man. A heart attack caused him to be admitted to the intensive care unit. A pill cocktail was administered, stabilizing him for the moment. Following this, a cursory physical examination revealed symptoms of a weak heartbeat. With his physical condition in mind, he was left to recover in his room. A nurse discovered the man dead in his bed the morning after; he was one of 72 patients who died in 1987. </p>

<p>Not only did the rate of mortality increase from 19% to 22%, but so did the level of disorder. Some rooms lacked private bathrooms, call systems, or even patient monitoring equipment. Expired drugs were not thrown away but were allowed to ferment in their capsules. Vital medicines were prescribed but they were hardly ever given to those who needed them. The kitchen workspace had been infested with a multitude of flies and roaches. The ceilings began to leak water onto the unsuspecting inhabitants. The deplorable conditions seem to be the only thing that has remained consistent throughout its history.</p>

<p>An inspection by the state health department prompted them to warn that should the staff at the hospital fail to fix these serious issues with their staffing and management, a closure was imminent. With this warning taken into consideration, on May 12th, 1988, the staff handed over their operating license to the state. Flushing Hospital Medical Center bought out the facility and resumed medical treatment for the ill that same year. </p>
<br>
<p>This change in ownership lasted for a brief time as the 1990s brought us closer to the new millennium. In 1996, pressure started to build as they began to file for bankruptcy. Many assets, including the building, were sold off to a neighboring church to avoid veering off the edge of closure. Where they would soon enough have issues arise regarding the purchase.</p>
<br>
<p>No action was taken in regard to rehabilitating or even demolishing it. Talks of selling the building to an undisclosed seller were made, though there are no records to back this claim. Plans for reusing the interior were not considered in favor of developing a mixed-use community center over its foundation. It is highly unlikely we'll ever see anything done considering the large number of DOE (Department of Energy) violations that trace back decades. Until then, it stands unguarded and vulnerable to man and nature alike. </p>
