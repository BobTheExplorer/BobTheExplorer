<p>Inside Flushing lies an unusual building surrounded by residential housing complexes. From the street, one can observe the various pieces of graffiti spread liberally across its façade. Had it not been for the large sign labeled “Flushing Hospital Medical Center North Division” one could never attribute this hospital as anything but an eyesore for the neighborhood.</p>

<p> Beyond its brick walls is a maze of tight corridors and turns, with areas that highlight the full brunt of decay. Light fixtures hang by a thread in parts ravaged by the elements and possibly by man. The painted walls have undergone the process of peeling off, and paint chips have mixed into the already muddled flooring. With such a high level of decrepitude, it is hard to believe that patients once resided within these very same rooms. </p>

<p>Since it first opened its doors to the public in 1936, it has been the subject of lawsuits and malpractice. </p>

<p> One of the earliest cases was that of Mr. Holub, a 75-year-old man who sought aid for his bleeding penis. A two-stage prostatectomy was performed by one of the eight practicing doctors at the facility. Shortly after the first stage of the operation was complete, he was assisted to the bathroom by a nurse. Inside, he was left unattended and fell with such a great force that his skull fractured upon the floor. During this, the attending nurse sat at a desk 20 feet away unaware of what had transpired. After 20 grueling minutes, he managed to stumble his way out of the bathroom, only for not a single nurse to be in sight. On January 28, 1958, he succumbed to his wounds and died. </p>
