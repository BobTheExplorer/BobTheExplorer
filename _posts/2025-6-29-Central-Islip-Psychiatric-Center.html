Ever since the policy of deinstitutionalization began to take root in the 70s, various state-run psychiatric centers in Long Island started to close. One of the first to go was the Edgewood State Hospital in 1971, followed by the Kings Park Psychiatric Center and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160610082310/http://opacity.us/site94_central_islip_state_hospital.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Islip Psychiatric Center</a> in 1996. Patients from Edgewood State Hospital were transferred to the Central Islip Psychiatric Center, and when it and KPPC (Kings Park Psychiatric Center) were closed, all the small groups of patients that remained were sent to Pilgrim Psych.

Only the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center managed to continue operations; even so, much of the campus was abandoned until the arrival of demolition work in 2003 and 2012. All that remains of the old abandoned part of the campus is the power plant accompanied by 2 gutted warehouses, along with the iconic neo-colonial-style watchtower, which also happens to be completely gutted inside.

Well before its official closure in 1996, the idea of shuttering CI was discussed during the early 1980s, culminating with the New York Institute of Technology purchasing 546 acres of the 788-acre property in 1983. Exactly $5.5 million was spent on the purchase, and a further $30 million went to refurbishing the buildings for academic use. 

Owing to the fact that the grounds resemble a college campus, interest in reusing them was also expressed by Saint John's University and Dowling College. some shit about the cottage plan.

Prior to being shut down, the psychiatric center provided a source of employment for the community. Gradually the number of patients began to enter a steady decline in 1969, causing most employees to either be laid off or to move elsewhere. By the year 1980, 10.3% of the local population were unemployed, and 23.9% lived below the poverty line.

Recovering from these hard times was a slow yet steady change that picked up momentum when Matthew Schure, the second president of NYIT, announced his intentions of aiding the hamlet in its struggle. Much of the property was donated or sold to be developed into housing or retail/industrial space. Only 175 out of the original 788 acres still belonged to NYIT in 2000.

Portions of the property were still owned by the state, later being sold off to real estate developers; 52 acres were sold off to the Arlen Contracting Corporation in 2000 for the price of $2.2 million ($3.5 million in 2025). Exactly 6 buildings were included in the parcel: the laundry building, medical/surgical building, power plant, food distribution center, and two administration buildings. 

Plans were drawn up to reuse the buildings, with the idea of converting them to suit various interests; the power plant was intended to become a gym and daycare center, the food distribution center was to become classrooms . Just the medical/surgical building and adminstration building(s) were actually reused.

Additional plans for a courthouse complex, federal courthouse, and a neighboring lawschool were well underway by 1996.  

Unfortunately, not all of the former state hospital buildings were reused by NYIT. Several were demolished over the years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zI23KZ4EQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the power plant</a>, laundry building, and food distribution center were among the first ones to go in 2006</a>. Afterwards came the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/8atPQ2 "target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corcoran buildings in 2008</a>, which were identical to buildings 21 and 22 at KPPC (Kings Park Psychiatric Center).
