What’s the NYC Goss
Yo check out this dog who ran free and spent ten hours exploring subway tunnels. My kinda puffball.

The NYC Subway system is now open again 24-7 though really that never mattered to explorers and graffiti artists. We own the damn place whatever hour we want.

Metro North has finally gotten the go-ahead to build stations in the Bronx and access Penn Station via Hell Gate Bridge. The existing tracks belong to Amtrak, but they don’t feature any local stops. The increase in train traffic over Hell Gate will add a small layer of complexity to the long hike to the main span…

Shorty’s Short Shorts:
Texas is, uh, different. A long abandoned nursing home there is going to be demolished, and a local news crew went inside to shoot footage for their story. The footage is awesome—complete with penis scrawls on chairs, incredibly bad graffiti (that “Ghost” is next level bad), and can you spot the actual loot? Texans might be OK at BBQ but they just don’t know how to properly scrap out and loot a buildings.

The old jail in Augusta is slated for demolition. Too bad they won’t be demolishing it with all the governor and his racist new voting policies inside.

A Minneapolis teen was injured while exploring the apparently cursed Fruen Mill site, where numerous other injuries and at least one death have taken place over the last two decades. No word on what his Insta is, or if he at least got some great sock boy sponsorship photos. #DoItForTheSocks

Detained migrants in Australia started tunneling their way out of a detention facility and given how many man-made tunnels there are at the US/Mexico border, I’d bet it’s just a matter of time before this happens here.

Speaking of man-made tunnels, The Israeli military lied about a land invasion of Gaza last week in order to entrap Hamas fighters in a rudimentary tunnel system which they then bombarded from the air. The story begs the question of how many secret tunnels are under Gaza? It’s safe to assume “a lot”, though I doubt anyone other than Hamas members will be exploring them anytime in our lifetime—and that sucks. I’d bet a nickel they have a tunnel network that rivals the catacombs of Paris.

I’d be remiss if I didn’t offer this commentary on all things Israel/Palestine: Being pro-Palestine does not equal hating Jews. I’m Irish, I know repression when I see it. The number of children being maimed and killed there is unforgivable.

HS2’s tunnel construction has begun. Y’all know what to do!

A New Zealand man who was caught walking through their longest passenger train tunnel failed to show up for court. I hope he’s just lounging at home smoking a bowl thinking yeah man fuck the cops, walking ain’t illegal.
 

Bosnia has relocated a group of squatters from a ‘bando and I somehow doubt whatever camp they’re bring brought to is going to be better than their ‘bando…

India reopened a long abandoned hospital in order to help deal with Covid. Sure wish Cuomo did that last year in Queens, with any one of the hospitals we lost in recent years.

Yikes. Two teen boys were found shot to death in an abandoned house in New Orleans. Sounds like something shady went sideways.

Meanwhile, in the capital of all urban exploring (Olean, NY), a young dude left his fam and moved into a ‘bando house for two weeks. When authorities finally caught up with him he was kinda done living that trash panda life.

Abandoned Building BBQ
There was an abandoned church fire in Philly that missed two weeks back, though new reporting confirms that it was indeed an arson fire.

Some big ‘bando in STL burned up last week, hard to tell what it was from the video footage, but we can assume that’s one less ‘bando to explore.

Thank god someone set this abandoned house on fire in Fresno—I was starting to wonder if that town had disappeared off the map or something. And speaking of Cali, Bakersfield you ain’t looking good either! A full 35% of fires in that town were started in abandoned buildings, with fires dramatically up from 2019.

And that’s a wrap…
Honestly this CDC ‘you don’t need a mask’ recommendation is absolute bullshit. Fuck y’all. I’m wearing my ski mask until I die. And when I’m buried? That’s right. Ski Mask.
