<p>When the thought of abandoned or dare I say haunted psychiatric centers comes to mind, most locals think of former Kings Park Psychiatric Center(KPPC). Even to those who do not considers themselves all too adventerous can be seen on the grounds along with the elderly and young. It is not an uncommon sight to run into another a person when exploring any of the buildings on the acre long campus. Though the person you encounter are not always another keen explorer or juvenile graffiti artist. As cops have been known to frequent to patrol within buildings 93 & 7, handing out tickets to whomever is unlucky enough to encounter them. </p> 

<p>Aug 25, 1988 the state-run Office of Mental Health would declare a overcrowding crisis within hospitals and psychiatric centers alike. Patients are layed on beds that are hardly even a feet inches from one another, to them it is degrading and to the staff a logistical nightmare. Due to the overflowing amount of patients being recieved, many are carted off to other state-run facilites for treatment.</p>

<p>Many would see the monolithic 13th floor structure known as building 93 as undergo the process of institutionalization </p>
