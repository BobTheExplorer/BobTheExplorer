<p>When the thought of abandoned or, dare I say, haunted psychiatric centers comes to mind, most locals think of the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center(KPPC). Even those who do not consider themselves all too adventurous can be seen on the grounds, along with the elderly and young. It is not an uncommon sight to run into another person when exploring any of the buildings on the 368-acre-long campus. But the person you encounter is not always another keen explorer or juvenile graffiti artist. As cops have been known to frequently patrol within buildings № #93 & № #7, handing out tickets to whoever is unlucky enough to encounter them.</p>

<p>On August 25, 1988, the state-run Office of Mental Health would declare an overcrowding crisis within hospitals and psychiatric centers alike. Patients are laid on beds that are hardly even inches from one another, to them, it is degrading and to the staff a logistical nightmare. Due to the overflowing number of patients being received, many are carted off to other state-run facilities for treatment.</p>

<p>Many would see the monolithic 159-foot structure known as building 93 as they undergo the process of institutionalization, afterwards they would find residence on the active floors. Despite having 13 floors, only 1/3 of them were in use; the remaining 2/3 had been closed off since the 1970s.</p>
  
<p>The entirety of the building, along with many others on the grounds, would lock their doors permanently in 1996. Some buildings would still operate afterward; bldg № #7 would receive electricity until 2001, and bldg № #1 served patients until 2012.</p>
  
<!--- Do not forget to talk about how patients would be placed on the high levels if bed ridden, intermediately disabled where placed on the middle floors, and the barely disabled on the first few floors and Edgewood. -->
