<p>
Overnight, the natural cement industry would quickly fall off in the number of factories producing it within the Lower Albany area. With the advent of Portland Cement, a man-made concoction of limestone and clay. By the 1890s, its cost would be significantly lower than the price of natural cement. Its potential would lure investors from the surrounding Hudson River area and from abroad. A further 12 years onward would see a German-owned cement firm set up a large, sprawling industrial complex in the area. Smoke would doter the area from the 16 smokestacks that would watch overall. The cement plant had been among four of the leading cement suppliers that would dominate the Hudson Valley. Seemingly, this success would be short-lived as America declared war on Germany and its allies.
</p>
 
<p>
Operations would completely cease as the U.S. government would declare it an enemy-owned property. From there on, ownership would change hands multiple times, with each owner being as unsuccessful as the last. The last owner would sell it to another large Portland cement company in 1937, waking it from its brief slumber. Though only for a limited time as one of the worst economic global disasters, The Great Depression, would occur. As a result of this, it would be once again closed until the February of 1940.
</p>
  
<p>
The following year on November 26th, a crash would be heard all across the Hudson valley. Twenty cement silos would collapse, polluting the area with cement that had an estimate value of $1,000,000. Construction work local to the area had been buried underneath a layer of debris, additionally 15 trucks carrying cement were overturned and flattened. Signs of a disaster occurring would come earlier that morning, as one of the water mains would shatter causing the silos to crack. Furthermore, the grounds that they were situated on had begun to settle, causing instability within the structure. Despite this turn of events, 60 percent of the cement had been salvaged. 
</p>
  
<p>
Some moderate success would be seen as another world war would be waged overseas in the heartland of Europe and Asia. By the mid 1950s, the demand for cement had reached an all-time peak. New highways would be constructed across the nation, and homes for the returning valiant soldiers. Such demands would call for an expansion of the facilities. February 12th, 1959 about $8,000,000 would be spent on the construction of a kiln, a finishing mill, and twenty silos that could hold up to ten thousand barrels of cement.

&emsp;&emsp; Fort Totten is situated on the farmost edge of the Willets Point peninsula, facing the Long Island Sound and the neighboring Fort Schuyler. Both forts had been constructed during the third wave of naval fortifications after the devastating War of 1812. Construction on Fort Totten began in the year of 1862. Its development was spearheaded by William Petit Trowbridge, the then-current leader of the Army Engineer Agency of NYC. His role in the Army Engineers Agency would place him in charge of obtaining materials for the construction and overseeing repairs to Governors' Island and the nearby Fort Schuyler. The original design of the fort was intended to be four stories tall as opposed to its current two-story design. Not only that but additional casemates would be built on the hill behind it, store rooms, quarters, and other military purposes. This plan would quickly be dropped mainly due to the sudden advancement of technology in the ongoing Civil War, such as rifled artillery that would reduce the chiseled stone walls to ashes. The walls are quite a thing to marvel at, the exterior is rough to stand against the harsh waves yet the interior is smooth. However, that is only one of the many genius technological ideas produced by Jospeh Gilbert Totten. A West Point graduate, responsible for this base's design and many more within the US. He had thought of a solution to the crew operating cannons facing deadly threats, grapeshot from enemy naval ships or snipers. The introduction of iron shutters which would close after firing the cannon, allowing the crew to be shielded when reloading. Something to take notice of is that the cannons used blackpowder to fire the shells towards their foes. The surrounding area would become engulfed in smoke as a result of the blackpowder. Thus, a ventilation system had been installed to prevent the crew from being deterred of reloading their cannons. As seen in the picture below.



&emsp;&emsp; The cannons themselves were actually fair large, as result of this there is only a small walkway for its crew. Funnily enough this path had been nicknamed the "Monkeys Run" due to how crew members looked lugging heavy shells into the cannon. To get a sense of the scale of these cannons, they would of ran to the stone column on the left all the way to the shutters.

 Write about the room where cannons fire towards the walls and then connect it to the gunpowder storage room on the same floor and the flooded first floor 



<!-- The Willets farmhouse was constructed in 1829 in the Greek Revival style and is currently the oldest surviving structure at Fort Totten. Its existence predates the construction of the fort itself. It wasn't until the government bought the land that the house came to be at its current location. Its original location had been in the uppermost part of the peninsula, and so it would remain. It would then be used as an engineering office for the Army Corps of Engineers, until 1867. Under the orders of General Duane, it would be moved to its current location and be remodeled. It would be repurposed once again, serving as a dwelling for the officer in charge of the fort. Then it would see the Abbot family move into the house until it would be surpassed by the creation of the commanding officer's quarters in 1909. Despite this, it would see another alteration as in 1940 the single-family house would be converted into a two-family house. It would be abandoned shortly after this, now it lies fallow. Perhaps it will be renovated once again by the Bayside Historical Society which occupies a neighboring house. -->
